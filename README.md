# DATA-CLEANING-WITH-PYTHON-
Essential Python Data Cleaning Techniques 

 cleaning datasets is an important preliminary step for efficient analysis and modeling. Whether you are a data analyst, scientist or engineer, here are some key Python techniques I've found useful for assessing data quality and preparing it for downstream processes.

## Identifying Missing and Invalid Values

Pandas `.isnull()` and `.dropna()` methods allow you to quickly detect missing values and filter out incomplete records respectively. This is crucial for diagnosing data quality issues early on.

## Detecting Outliers and Duplicates  

Checking for unique values in each column helps identify potential outliers, errors or duplicate entries that need further validation.

## Formatting and Standardization

Using Pandas `.astype()` method to convert object and numeric columns to consistent data types like int, float improves structure for calculations and modeling.

## Handling Missing Data 

Filling in missing numeric data with mean, median or mode imputation via `.fillna()` ensures a complete dataset for analysis without losing observations. 

## Text Cleaning and Standardization

Methods like `.str.lower()`, `.str.strip()` help normalize text data while `.apply()` allows running custom functions for additional preprocessing as needed.

## Selecting Relevant Features

Subsetting the dataframe with `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]` keeps only predictor columns relevant to your problem, reducing noise and overhead.

## Column Renaming and Reorganization 

Renaming columns clearly and consolidating related fields with `.join()` results in a tidy structure optimized for exploration and model building.

Proper data preparation ultimately saves time and prevents faulty assumptions down the line.
